## Prerequisites

- You must have Java 8 to 17
- You must have Maven 3.6.3 or later
- [It is recommended to have `JAVA_HOME` setup in your environment](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/enterprise-performance-management-common/diepm/epm_set_java_home_104x6dd63633_106x6dd6441c.html)

_This project has been tested up to Java SE `17.0.1` and Maven `3.8.4`, but other versions may
work._

## Running

1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/RIT-SWEN-261-04/team-project-2211-swen261-04-h.git
```

_If you are using IntelliJ, you can use
the **[IntelliJ](https://github.com/RIT-SWEN-261-04/team-project-2211-swen261-04-h/tree/master#intellij)**
directions for steps 2-3._

### Terminal

2. Go to the root directory
3. Run the maven execution plugin

```
mvn compile exec:java
```

### IntelliJ

2. Open the root directory
3. Run the `Run` configuration, <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>F10</kbd>

### Play

5. Follow the directions and begin playing a game

## Known Bugs & Disclaimers

> ðŸ‘‰ Turn submission is not yet implemented

> ðŸ‘‰ After submitting a turn, move validation breaks. For more details on why, see [#32](https://github.com/RIT-SWEN-261-04/team-project-2211-swen261-04-h/issues/32)

> ðŸ‘‰ There are instances where routing breaks. e.g., players challenge another around the same time results in error message for second player [#34](https://github.com/RIT-SWEN-261-04/team-project-2211-swen261-04-h/issues/32)

## Testing

The Maven build script provides hooks for running unit tests and generating code coverage reports in
HTML.

### Run tests on all tiers together:

```
mvn clean test jacoco:report
```

Open `PROJECT_HOME/target/site/jacoco/index.html` in your browser

### Run tests on all the tiers in isolation:

```
mvn exec:exec@tests-and-coverage
```

Open `PROJECT_HOME/target/site/jacoco/{ui, appl, model}/index.html` in your browser

### Run tests on a single tier:

Where `tier` is one of `ui`, `appl`, `model`:

```
mvn clean test-compile surefire:test@tier jacoco:report@tier
``` 

Open `PROJECT_HOME/target/site/jacoco/{ui, appl, model}/index.html` in your browser

## Design Documentation

To generate a PDF of the Design documentation, execute the following command:

```
mvn exec:exec@docs
```

If you are using **IntelliJ** you can run the `Generate Design Documentation` configuration, <kbd>
Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>F10</kbd>
> _This command will fail on a clean project without a `/target` directory. Create the directory first if running after a `clean` operation without any intervening commands that create the directory, such as compile._

The generated PDF will be in the `PROJECT_HOME/target/` directory.

## Project Distribution (Zipfile)

To generate a zipfile distribution of the source for the project, execute the following command:

```
mvn exec:exec@zip
```

The generated distribution zipfile will be in `PROJECT_HOME/target/WebCheckers.zip`
